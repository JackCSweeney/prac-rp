Users can scroll through different available designs that licensed tattoo artists will upload to the application, select tattoos they would like to get, and be connected with the artist to schedule an appointment, chat about small details of the work, and finalize payment. The goal is to allow tattoo collectors to easily add to their collection and provide artists an opportunity to fill more of their schedule with quick and efficient appointments.",

  description: "Brain Food is a fullstack responsive web application that allows users to signup for an account, login, enter a mood level for the day on a sadness to happiness scale from 1-5, and enter time allotted to cook. Users can choose a color theme for the application dependent how they want to feel. When a mood level and time to cook input is entered, recipes will then populate based on nutritional value meant to either boost or maintain mood levels. Users have the option to favorite recipes and view details, such as cook time, nutritional content, ingredients needed to make the meal, and instructions on how to do so. A personal dashboard is available to view favorited recipes, delete recipes, view recipe details, search for recipes by name, view average mood level, and personally rate recipes on a star rating system. Brain Food was created using React Vite + TypeScript and tested with Cypress. Accessibility was assessed via Chrome DevTools Lighthouse and Chrome WAVE extension. Happy cooking!",

  description: "To put it frankly, this is a kind of stupid idea, but one that has let me play around and learn some different tools and concepts in a fun environment! The Crawfather is, for now, a simple chat bot utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT that will give you pretty bad fantasy football advice, with a shrimpy, criminal twist. The idea for this came from a chat bot, called 'Crow Daddy', from a dynasty fantasy football league I'm a part of and a very strange dream in which 'Crow Daddy' was replaced with a mobster, powered by shrimp-based AI. I have yet to figure out what that means exactly, but I guess this is my way of figuring that out. Regardless, it's been a fun little process of pulling this together and learning some new skills I haven't had the chance to utilize in other projects/work. Who knew it would so hard to make ChatGPT respond as shrimpy as I wanted?",

Much like a sampler, BeatWalk has options to change tempo, pitch, EQ, and compression of any sound before saving that altered sound. Those sounds are then able to be assigned to any of the 16 drumpads in the application, allowing users to create unique beats from any sound they can hear in the world.",
